The ones provided in the notebook service are the language kernel (python, scala and R, respectively) along with the paths and environmental variables defined for Spark Sessions. \n",

However, if you want to save a trip to the worker nodes for every computation, and all the data that you need for your computation is available locally on the Jupyter server node (which is the headnode), you can use the `%%local` magic to run the code snippet on the Jupyter server. Typically, you would use `%%local` magic in conjunction with the `%%sql` magic with `-o` parameter. The `-o` parameter would persist the output of the SQL query locally and then `%%local` magic would trigger the next set of code snippet to run locally against the output of the SQL queries that is persisted locally.\n",

    "# Machine learning: Predictive analysis on food inspection data using MLLib\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **MLLib**, Spark's built-in machine learning libraries, to perform a simple predictive analysis on an open dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MLLib?\n",
    "\n",
    "MLLib is a core Spark library that provides a number of utilities that are useful for machine learning tasks, including utilities that are suitable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hypothesis testing and calculating sample statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we describe a simple approach to *classification* through logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are classification and logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Classification*, a very common machine learning task, is the process of sorting input data into categories. It is the job of a classification algorithm to figure out how to assign \"labels\" to input data that you provide. For example, you could think of a machine learning algorithm that accepts stock information as input and divides the stock into two categories: stocks which you should sell and stocks which you should retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is the algorithm that you use for classification here. Spark's logistic regression API is useful for *binary classification*, or classifying input data into one of two groups. For more information about logistic regressions, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the process of logistic regression produces a *logistic function* that can be used to predict the probability that an input vector belongs in one group or the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are we trying to accomplish in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use Spark to perform some predictive analysis on food inspection data (**Food_Inspections1.csv**) that was acquired through the [City of Chicago data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). This dataset contains information about food inspections that were conducted in Chicago, including information about each food establishment that was inspected, the violations that were found (if any), and the results of the inspection. This is not the raw data provided by the city: the raw data has been edited to make parsing easier, and we are only using about 1/10th of the complete dataset\\*. You can download the raw data at the data portal website.\n",
